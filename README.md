* Source code can be found in the sprout directory. The java file is the directory: `sprout/src/automationFramework/TwitterTesting.java`
 * Can be run via importing into eclipse and running as a TestNG Test
* To run the executable file (location: `executable/executableTest.jar`: 
  *  Run `java -jar executableTest.jar` via command line
   *  You must also have the file `chromedriver` in the executable folder when you run the jar. As long as the jar file and `chromedriver` are in the same directory there shouldnt be a problem running it
