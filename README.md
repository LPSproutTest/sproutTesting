# sproutTesting
* Source code can be found in the sprout directory. The java file is the directory: sprout/src/TwitterTesting.java
* To run the executable file: 
  *  Run java -jar executableTest.jar via commandline
   *  You must also have the chromedriver.exe file in the executable folder when you run the jar. As long as the jar file and chromedriver.exe are in the same directory it should work fine.
